/**
 * Tone mapping, the sRGB transfer function, and a dither — done here rather
 * than by the renderer, for the one reason that cannot be worked around.
 *
 * **Why take this over at all.** `RenderPipeline` applies ACES and the sRGB
 * conversion itself, after `outputNode`, whenever `outputColorTransform` is
 * true. That is convenient and it leaves no place to stand: the last thing that
 * happens to a frame is quantisation to 8 bits, and if every node in the chain
 * runs before the tone curve then no node runs late enough to dither. So this
 * sets `outputColorTransform = false` and does the same three steps the
 * renderer would have, plus a fourth.
 *
 * The first three are not reimplemented — `renderOutput` is the very node
 * `RenderPipeline` uses, handed the same tone mapping and colour space. With the
 * dither amplitude at zero this stage is therefore the renderer's own output
 * path, which is exactly the property that makes it safe to adopt: it can be
 * verified by capturing a frame with dithering off and comparing it against one
 * captured before this file existed.
 *
 * **Why dither is worth an architectural change.** Quantising a smooth gradient
 * to 256 levels produces banding — visible steps where the underlying signal
 * changes by less than one level per pixel. This scene is close to a worst case
 * for it: sky and open water are large, smooth, low-contrast gradients, and they
 * occupy most of every frame in the gallery. A dither of the right shape trades
 * that structured artefact for unstructured noise below the quantisation step,
 * which the eye integrates away entirely.
 *
 * **The dither is triangular, not uniform, and that matters.** Adding a single
 * uniform random value decorrelates the quantisation error from the signal only
 * partly: the error's *variance* still depends on where the signal sits between
 * two levels, which is visible as noise that pulses across a gradient. The
 * difference of two independent uniform values — a triangular probability
 * density, ±1 LSB wide — makes both the mean and the variance of the error
 * independent of the signal. That is the standard result from audio dithering
 * and it transfers directly; it costs one extra hash.
 *
 * **The noise is static, and it has to be.** It is a pure function of pixel
 * coordinates with no time term. Animating it would look better in motion, and
 * would make every captured frame a function of how many frames preceded it —
 * which is the one property this project's entire visual harness rests on. A
 * fixed pattern is the price of a reproducible screenshot.
