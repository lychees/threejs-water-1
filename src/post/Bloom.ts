/**
 * Veiling glare, from three's own bloom node.
 *
 * **Bought, not built — the only stage in `src/post/` that is, and it is worth
 * saying why.** `BloomNode` is a five-level mip pyramid with separable Gaussian
 * blurs, a smoothed luminance high-pass, and per-level tint weights; it resizes
 * itself from the drawing buffer on every render and disposes its own targets.
 * Reimplementing that would be several hundred lines arriving at the same image.
 * The other three stages here are hand-written because each needs something the
 * stock node cannot express — a thin-lens circle of confusion, an anchor on the
 * actual sun, a per-preset CDL. This one needs nothing the stock node does not
 * already do, and "we wrote it ourselves" is not a feature.
 *
 * **The threshold tracks the preset's exposure, and it has to.** This chain runs
 * in linear HDR — `RenderPipeline.outputColorTransform` applies ACES and the
 * sRGB conversion *after* `outputNode` — so it is tempting to say a threshold of
 * 1.0 selects light that exceeded the sensor. It does not, because
 * `toneMappingExposure` is applied at that same later stage: what will read as
 * white in the finished frame is not 1.0 in this chain but `1 / exposure`.
 *
 * The presets run from 0.42 to 1.35, so a fixed threshold of 1.0 means very
 * different things across them — and at Clear Day's 0.42 it sits at 42% of white
 * and admits most of the sky. That was not a subtle error: the first cut of this
 * blew the sunset shot to a white sheet and put a hard glowing blob on open
 * water in the clear-day shot. Deriving it from the exposure instead is what
 * makes "bloom the highlights" mean the same thing in all nine places.
 *
 * **Half resolution, deliberately.** The output is a wide Gaussian; nothing in
 * it is resolvable at full resolution, so the pyramid runs at half and costs a
 * quarter. `updateBefore` re-derives its size from the drawing buffer every
 * frame and multiplies by the scale, so this survives a resize with no hook.

    // radius over a sea full of sun glitter lays a milky veil across everything
    // instead of putting a glow around the highlights. Measured on the clear-day
    // shot: at 0.6 the open water went visibly hazy and a single specular hit
    // became a glowing orb.

    // This is the difference between a bloom and a white sheet, and the reason

    // disc for exactly that reason. Feeding that number into an additive bloom
    // gives an additive result 19000 units tall: the first cut of this erased
    // the sunset shot's rigging and sails into a single blown highlight.
