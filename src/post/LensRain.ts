/**
 * Rain on the lens, as a post-processing node graph.
 *
 * Water on glass is not simulated here. It is *sampled*: the screen is divided
 * into a lattice of cells and each cell hashes to at most one droplet — a
 * position, a radius, a birth phase — so the whole field is a pure function of
 * screen position, time and a handful of uniforms. Nothing is stored between
 * frames, which is what makes the effect free to start, stop, rewind and run on
 * a backend with no compute shaders.
 *
 * Four such lattices are composited at different scales and rates. One lattice
 * on its own always reads as a lattice; four, with different cell aspects, seeds
 * and turnover rates, do not.
 *
 * Three things carry most of the look:
 *
 *   1. **Droplets are lenses, not decals.** Each one is a spherical cap; the
 *      surface normal is derived from the distance to the cap's centre, the view
 *      ray is refracted through it at the air/water interface, and the *image*
 *      is read back from the scene colour at the displaced coordinate. A drop on
 *      glass is a plano-convex lens of focal length ~3r, so the plane it images
 *      sits a few radii behind it and the picture inside a drop comes out
 *      inverted and wide-angle — which is exactly what a drop on a window looks
 *      like, and what a normal-map smear never manages.
 *   2. **Big drops run, small ones do not.** Contact-angle hysteresis pins a
 *      drop's contact line with a force that scales with its perimeter, while
 *      gravity pulls on its volume, so there is a critical radius above which a
 *      drop breaks away and below which it sits (Furmidge's criterion). That
 *      single comparison is what sorts the field into static beads and runners,
 *      rather than a flag hung on a layer.
 *   3. **Runners stick and slip.** The same pinning that holds a small drop in
 *      place keeps grabbing a large one on its way down, so a real leak crawls
 *      and lurches. The travel curve is deliberately non-linear for that reason;
 *      a drop moving at constant speed reads as an animated texture.
 *
 * Cost is one branch on a clear frame. Everything below the top-level `If` is
 * skipped when the glass is dry, the layer count is a uniform-coherent branch
 * per lattice, and — this is the reason the field is accumulated before anything
 * is sampled — the number of texture reads does not depend on the layer count at
 * all. Adding a lattice costs arithmetic, never bandwidth.
 *
 * Backend note: the lattice is built in a square metric (screen *height* units)
 * derived from `screenSize`, so cells stay square and drops stay round at any
 * aspect ratio, with no resize hook to keep in sync. Every texture read sits
 * either at the top level or inside a branch whose condition is a uniform, which
 * both WGSL's uniformity analysis and GLSL's implicit-derivative rules require.

 * stay individually visible, so what the frame showed was not a defocused image
 * but eight superimposed copies of it. Against thin high-contrast geometry —

 * over a disc goes as `N / (pi r^2)`, so a radius chosen without reference to
 * the tap count "would start to read as individual samples rather than as a
 * defocused image". That is exactly what happened here. So the gather is now the
 * same sunflower spiral the depth of field uses, and `applyParams` scales the

 *     frame at 60 Hz. Measured: a camera lifted clear at 10.5 m/s left the lens
 *     completely dry. What *did* satisfy it was a teleport — which is to say a
 *     camera cut, which is the one time there is no water.
 *   - **Full rain coverage is not what a dive leaves.** It put a storm's whole
 *     droplet population on the glass, on a cloudless day, from one dunk.
 *   - **And then dried it as rain.** `dryTime` is 7.5 s: still visibly wet after
 *     15, clear only after 30.
 *
 * A film charges while the lens is under and drains when it is out, with no edge
 * test anywhere, so a slow swim up and a wave over the lens both do the obvious

     * worth keeping the record of what it cost. That version fired when
     * submersion fell from above 0.5 to below 0.05, on the reasonable assumption
     * that the only way to do that is to come up through the surface — and a
     * camera cut satisfied it exactly. Cutting from the underwater shot to a
     * clear-day one flooded the lens to full coverage on the first settle step,
     * and since it then dried on the rain constant while a settle run is a second
     * and a half, the clear-day frame was photographed through a screenful of
     * droplets. That is what the `island-approach` baseline looked like, being
     * the shot that follows `underwater` in the list.
     *
     * The rate-based film cannot fire on a cut at all — there is no edge to
     * detect — but it *can* still be carried over one if it is not cleared here,
     * which is the half of the bug that survives the redesign.
     *
     * It is *not* what `tests/isolation.spec.ts` measures, which was worth
     * checking rather than assuming — that test goes storm to clear-day with
     * nothing submerged in between, and its figure was unmoved (1.598 before,
     * 1.595 after). Its residual is sea state surviving the reset, which is a
     * separate leak and still open.
