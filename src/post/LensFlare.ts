/**
 * Flare from the key light — anchored to it, occluded by the scene, and above
 * water only.
 *
 * **Not the pseudo-flare.** Three ships a `LensflareNode` implementing John
 * Chapman's technique: take the bloom texture, and pivot a chain of ghosts about
 * screen centre from *every* surviving bright sample. It is a good effect on a
 * scene with one or two isolated highlights. This scene is a sea covered in sun
 * glitter and breaking whitecaps, and every one of them would throw its own
 * ghost chain. So the source here is not "whatever is bright" but the light
 * itself, projected.
 *
 * **The anchor is a projection, not a search.** The key light's direction is
 * projected to screen coordinates on the CPU once per frame into a uniform.
 * There is no readback and no per-pixel projection.
 *
 * **The gate is angular, and it is the part most worth getting right.** The
 * whole effect is scaled by `smoothstep(-0.25, 0.45, dot(viewDir, sunDir))` —
 * how nearly the camera is pointed at the light — rather than by an
 * in-front-of-the-camera test. A boolean there is correct and looks wrong: it
 * switches the flare on the frame the light crosses the 90-degree plane, which
 * is a pop in the middle of a pan. The angular form fades it out over tens of
 * degrees, so a camera sweeping past the sun sees the flare arrive and leave.
 * This is the construction `reinder`'s *Himalayas* uses, itself crediting mu6k.
 *
 * **The occlusion is a depth test, so the flare belongs to the scene.** Eight
 * taps on a small disc at the light's screen position; a tap is clear when its
 * depth reads at the far plane. Behind the island, behind the hull, behind the
 * rigging, the flare goes with it. Without this it floats over solid geometry
 * and reads as an overlay — which is exactly what it would be.
 *
 * **Ghosts sit on a radially warped axis.** Their positions are laid out along
 * `-uvd` where `uvd = uv · |uv|` rather than along the plain vector to centre.
 * The warp stretches the chain toward the frame edge, which is what an actual
 * chain of internal reflections does, because each element images the aperture
 * at a different magnification.
 *
 * **The moon is the same lens, and reading it wrong is an easy trap.**
 * `Atmosphere` owns *one* directional light and retargets it to the moon once
 * the sun is down, overwriting its colour with `MOON_LIGHT_COLOR`. Meanwhile
 * `atmosphere.sunColor` goes on reporting the solar extinction colour whatever
 * the hour. So this class takes a direction and a colour from its caller and
 * makes no assumption about which body it is looking at — `main` hands it the
 * live key light, which follows the retarget.
