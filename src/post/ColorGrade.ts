/**
 * A global colour grade, as the last thing that happens to the image before the
 * lens gets hold of it.
 *
 * **ASC CDL, and that choice is the whole design.** The grade is
 * `(x · slope + offset) ^ power`, per channel, followed by a saturation blend
 * about Rec.709 luma. That is the American Society of Cinematographers' colour
 * decision list — the interchange format a colourist's decisions are actually
 * shipped in — and it is defined on *linear* values, which is exactly what this
 * pass has. A lift/gamma/gain grade would have been the more obvious reach and
 * is defined on display-referred values; applying one here, before the tone
 * curve, would mean its gamma term was operating on scene radiance and doing
 * something quite unlike what its name promises.
 *
 * **Why here, and not after tone mapping.** `RenderPipeline` applies
 * `renderer.toneMapping` and the sRGB conversion *after* `outputNode`, because
 * `outputColorTransform` defaults to true. So everything in this chain is linear
 * HDR, and this pass shapes what ACES then compresses rather than fighting the
 * compression afterwards. Grading on top of a tone curve is how a highlight that
 * has already been rolled off gets pushed back up into a flat white; grading
 * underneath it means a warmed highlight is still a highlight when ACES gets to
 * it.
 *
 * **What this is not.** It is not a second exposure control — `toneMappingExposure`
 * is already per preset and already does that job, and duplicating it here would
 * give two knobs that fight. It is not a look *invention* either: each preset's
 * grade reinforces what that preset already is, because a preset that needs a
 * grade to become itself was not finished.
 *
 * The pass is not tiered. It costs a handful of arithmetic ops with no texture
 * reads, and a tier that dropped it would make the same preset a different
 * colour on different hardware — which is a worse outcome than the cost it
 * saves. Nor does it claim to be a pass-through at identity: the node graph is
 * built once and the grade lives in uniforms, so `pow` and `mix` are in every
 * frame at every tier, and `pow(x, 1)` is not guaranteed to return `x` bit-exactly.
