/**
 * Volumetric sea fog, as a post-processing node graph.
 *
 * The medium is an exponential height layer: extinction is `density` at
 * `baseHeight` and falls off with an e-folding height of `heightFalloff`, so the
 * fog pools on the water and thins with altitude. That single property is what
 * separates sea fog from a haze — from the deck you are inside it and the
 * horizon is gone; from a mast or an orbit camera you are above it looking down
 * at a bank with a top surface.
 *
 * Three things are integrated along each view ray:
 *
 *   1. **Transmittance, analytically.** For a medium whose density varies only
 *      with height, the optical depth along a straight ray has a closed form
 *      (Wenzel, "Real-Time Atmospheric Effects in Games", SIGGRAPH 2006 — see
 *      `transmittanceAt` below). No march required. So how much of the scene
 *      survives the fog is *exact*, at every quality tier, and identical whether
 *      the march runs 8 steps or 48. This matters more than it sounds: the tier
 *      drops on its own when frames get long, and a fog whose thickness visibly
 *      changed with the step count would turn an invisible quality change into an
 *      obvious one. It also means the effect has no banding in its opacity at
 *      all, which is where a naive volumetric normally shows its steps first.
 *
 *   2. **In-scattering, marched — but weighted analytically.** Each march cell
 *      contributes `L * (T(cellStart) - T(cellEnd))`, which is the *exact*
 *      integral of `sigma * T` across that cell, not a Riemann rectangle. Two
 *      things follow. The sum telescopes to `1 - T(end)` regardless of how many
 *      cells there are, so the total in-scattered energy is step-count
 *      independent in the same way the transmittance is — this is Hillaire's
 *      energy-conserving segment integration (Frostbite, SIGGRAPH 2015) with the
 *      constant-extinction assumption dropped, since here `T` is known in closed
 *      form and does not need one. And the far cells, which this march
 *      deliberately makes long, stop over-contributing: a rectangle rule
 *      overestimates a cell of optical depth ~1 by about 40%.
 *
 *      What the march is actually for is the part that is *not* analytic: how the
 *      light reaching each point varies. Two terms do that. The sun's
 *      transmittance down to a sample is itself a closed-form height integral
 *      (`sigma * H / sun.y`), so fog deep in the layer is lit far less than fog
 *      near its top — the bank glows along its upper surface and goes blue-grey
 *      inside, with no shadow map and no secondary march. And a Henyey–Greenstein
 *      lobe on the angle between the view ray and the sun makes looking toward the
 *      sun through fog bloom, while looking away from it stays flat and cool. The
 *      phase term is constant along the ray for a directional light, so it is
 *      evaluated once per pixel rather than once per step.
 *
 *   3. **An analytic tail.** Past `maxDistance` the march stops, but the fog does
 *      not, and stopping the integral there would leave a visible shell at that
 *      radius. The remaining segment is closed out with the same
 *      `L * (T(end) - T(scene))` the cells use, which costs one more evaluation
 *      per pixel and makes `maxDistance` a pure performance control with no
 *      visual signature. Together with item 2 this means that for a uniformly lit
 *      medium the whole pass collapses *exactly* to `scene * T + L * (1 - T)` —
 *      the classic fog lerp, which is the correct limit to degrade to. Everything
 *      that makes it volumetric is the structure layered on top of that.
 *
 * Banks are a two-octave procedural field modulating the *scattering*, not the
 * extinction. That is a deliberate approximation and worth being honest about:
 * modulating extinction would make the banks vary in opacity, which is more
 * correct, but it also destroys the closed-form transmittance that item 1 is
 * built on and hands the banding back. What varies most visibly in real fog at
 * any distance is which patches are catching the light, and that is exactly what
 * modulating the scattered radiance reproduces — at the cost of a silhouette that
 * is smoother than the interior.
 *
 * Nothing here is temporally jittered. The published froxel solutions
 * (Wronski 2014, Hillaire 2015) reproject and jitter across frames because they
 * are backed by a TAA resolve; this project has none, so a temporal offset would
 * be a shimmer with nothing to average it away. The march start is dithered
 * spatially only, with interleaved gradient noise against the pixel coordinate.
 *
 * The whole graph is built once. Every tunable is a uniform, including the march
 * step count (a dynamic `Loop` bound, as the tier changes it), so nothing here
 * ever recompiles. The march is procedural throughout — no 3D noise texture, so
 * nothing to allocate, upload or keep resident, and nothing that would need a
 * storage or compute path on WebGL2.
 *
 * Backend note: a post-processing pass is drawn with an internal fullscreen quad
 * and its own orthographic camera, so the built-in `cameraNear` / `cameraFar` /
 * `cameraProjectionMatrix` nodes would resolve to *that* quad, not the scene's.
 * The scene camera is therefore supplied explicitly via `setCamera` and its
 * near/far, inverse projection and world matrix are pushed into uniforms each
 * frame — the same approach `PassNode` takes internally, and the same one
 * `UnderwaterPass` in this project already takes for its shaft march.
