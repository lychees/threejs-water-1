/**
 * Rain wetting for loaded glTF surfaces.
 *
 * Two things happen to a surface under rain, and both are cheap to express:
 *
 * **It darkens.** A water film is optically thicker than air, so light that
 * scatters out of the substrate is more likely to be reflected back into it at
 * the film's top surface and absorbed on a second pass. The albedo a viewer
 * measures therefore falls, typically by a third to a half on porous materials
 * like wood and canvas — which is most of this ship.
 *
 * **It gets glossier.** The film fills the microfacet valleys, so the effective
 * roughness collapses toward that of a flat water surface. This is what actually
 * reads as "wet" — the darkening alone looks like a lighting change.
 *
 * **And it is not uniform.** Rain falls downward, so the deck and the upper faces
 * of the rail soak while the underside of a beam stays dry. Wetting the whole
 * object equally is the giveaway that made the first version read as a lighting
 * change rather than as weather: nothing in the frame told you where the water
 * was coming from.
 *
 * That last part was previously written off as too expensive, on the grounds that
 * it needs the world normal and therefore a node graph per material, with a
 * rebuild of materials the asset loader shares between clones. That turned out to
 * be wrong on both counts. The loader already converts every glTF material to
 * `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial`, so there is a node graph either way; and three
 * publishes `materialColor` and `materialRoughness`, which are precisely the
 * `color * map` and `roughness * roughnessMap.g` compositions its own shading
 * would have built. Wrapping those keeps the glTF's textures composing exactly as
 * before and needs no knowledge of which maps a given material happens to carry.
 *
 * Sharing is a feature here rather than a problem: the mask is evaluated per
 * fragment from the geometric normal, so one material serves every clone and each
 * still wets according to how its own surfaces are turned.
 *
 * The graph is attached in `adopt`, during scene load, and driven afterwards by a
 * single uniform — so no frame in gameplay pays a shader compile, and there is no
 * per-material CPU work per frame at all.

 * stopping dead at the silhouette. Zero produces a hard terminator exactly at the
