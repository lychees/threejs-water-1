/**
 * The hero sailing ship.
 *
 * The Poly Haven model arrives in its own units and its own frame: the hull runs
 * along +X from x = -10.33 (transom) to x = +11.63 (stem), the bowsprit reaches
 * further still, and the origin sits somewhere inside the hull rather than at
 * the waterline. None of that is usable directly, so `load()` normalises it:
 *
 *   - uniform scale so the hull is `TARGET_HULL_LENGTH` metres stem to stern;
 *   - recentred on the hull's horizontal centroid;
 *   - shifted vertically so the design waterline is exactly y = 0.
 *
 * After normalisation `object` is a plain `Object3D` whose origin is the point
 * buoyancy drives, and whose **forward direction is +X** (see `forwardLocal`).
 * That is the model's native heading; rotating it to some other convention would
 * mean carrying a correction into every probe point and every wake emission for
 * no gain.
