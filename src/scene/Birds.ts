/**
 * A flock of gulls, animated entirely on the GPU.
 *
 * **No downloaded asset.** A rigged glTF gull was not obtainable under a licence
 * this project can verify, and at the distance these are seen — a 1.4 m wingspan
 * at 50 to 250 m, so a couple of dozen pixels across — instanced procedural
 * geometry is the right technique anyway. A skinned mesh would spend
 * a bone palette and a per-bird draw on detail that never reaches the framebuffer,
 * and would still need a flight model written by hand on top of it. Seven
 * triangles and a vertex shader get the two things that actually read at this
 * size: the silhouette, and the way it moves.
 *
 * The whole system is **one instanced draw**. Geometry is a single gull built in
 * code — a body, a delta tail, and one quad per wing — and every bird is that
 * geometry deformed and placed by the vertex stage. The CPU never writes a
 * transform.
 *
 * `InstancedBufferGeometry` on a plain `Mesh` rather than `InstancedMesh`, for
 * the same reason `Weather` and `Particles` do it: there is no per-instance
 * matrix to carry. Every transform here is derived on the GPU from the clock and
 * a handful of per-instance constants, so an `instanceMatrix` would be a buffer
 * of identity matrices multiplied into every vertex for nothing.
 *
 * **Everything is a pure function of one clock.** No integrator, no per-frame
 * state, no boids. Each bird runs a closed circuit whose position, velocity and
 * acceleration all have closed forms in the path parameter, which is what makes
 * `resetClock(t)` land on the exact pose for time `t` — the property the visual
 * regression harness depends on, and the property a simulation could not offer at
 * any price. It is also why the flock costs a single uniform write per frame.
 *
 * No compute, no storage textures, nothing WebGPU-only: the same node graph has
 * to compile on the WebGL2 fallback.
