/**
 * Kelp and seagrass on the shallow bottom, animated entirely on the GPU.
 *
 * The submerged scene had rocks, fish and suspended matter and nothing that
 * grows. That is a specific kind of wrong rather than a missing feature: rocks
 * are static because rocks *are* static, so a seafloor made only of rock and
 * sand reads as a diorama however good the light on it is. A bed of weed is the
 * one thing down there that moves with the water, and it is therefore the thing
 * that tells the viewer the water is moving at all.
 *
 * Four ideas carry the module.
 *
 * **The sway is the swell, not a decoration.** Under a surface gravity wave the
 * water near the bed sweeps back and forth along the wave's direction of travel
 * with an excursion of `a / sinh(k h)` — linear wave theory, exactly the field
 * the ocean surface is built from. So the bed is driven by the same wavelength,
 * the same direction and the same clock the surface is, and the spatial term
 * `k · x` means the sway arrives at each plant as a travelling wave rather than
 * as a bed of metronomes. When the swell turns, the weed turns with it; when it
 * lengthens, the weed slows down. Nothing here is tuned to *resemble* the water.
 *
 * **A plant is a cantilever.** The response envelope is `s²` with `s` running 0
 * at the holdfast to 1 at the tip, which is the static deflection of a beam
 * under a distributed load and, more to the point, is exactly zero and exactly
 * flat at the anchor. A plant whose base moves at all reads as a decal sliding
 * on the sand. The phase then lags along the length, so the tip trails the base
 * and the plant carries its own travelling wave — that lag is the whole
 * difference between weed and a windscreen wiper.
 *
 * **Everything is one instanced draw and one pure function of two phases.**
 * Geometry is a single blade built in code; every blade in the forest is that
 * blade placed and deformed by the vertex stage from three per-instance vec4s.
 * The CPU writes two scalars per frame and never touches a transform. There is
 * no integrator and no remembered position, so `resetClock(t)` lands on the pose
 * for `t` exactly, which is what the visual regression harness needs.
 *
 * **Placement is derived from the heightfield, never from coordinates.** The
 * island is at a position and a radius this file does not know and must not
 * assume — it is `ISLAND`, and it changes. Sites are rejection-sampled against
 * `seafloorHeight`: a light-limited depth band, a slope limit, and a preference
 * for hollows over exposed flank. Move the island or deepen the shelf and the
 * beds follow, because the beds were never anywhere else.
 *
 * No compute, no storage textures, no per-frame allocation: the same node graph
 * has to compile on the WebGL2 fallback.
 *
 * Known limitation: the blades do not collide with anything. A reef boulder can
 * stand in the middle of a bed and have kelp growing through it. Fixing that
 * needs the prop transforms, which live in another module, for an intersection
 * that is a few blades out of thousands.

 * runs from 14.5 m to 21.0 m and never once comes up past 14 — the heightfield's
 * relief is nowhere near as wide as its amplitude suggests, because four octaves
 * of value noise concentrate hard around their mean. A seagrass meadow there
 * would be a seagrass meadow in twilight, which is not a thing.
 *
 * So the plateau's low growth is understorey turf rather than a meadow: the same
 * short many-bladed tuft, planted in the band the plateau actually offers, and
 * tinted between the two palettes because red and brown algae are what grows
 * under a kelp canopy at that depth. It is also, incidentally, the more useful
 * thing to have there — the reef's kelp stands need something between them, and
 * bare sand between them is what the scene already had.
 *
 * The depth bands themselves are the light limit. Kelp needs roughly 1% of
 * surface irradiance to hold a canopy, which in water this turbid is the top
 * twenty metres; seagrass is a higher-light plant and sits shallower still.
 * These are why a bed appears where the floor comes up and stops where it falls
 * away, and they are the cheapest possible way to make growth look like it chose
