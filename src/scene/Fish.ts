/**
 * Schools of fish, over the plateau, the reef and the island's shallows.
 *
 * **Why the geometry is procedural rather than a downloaded asset.** A rigged
 * glTF fish under a licence this project can verify was not obtainable, and for
 * a school at this scale it would have been the wrong technique anyway: a rig
 * means either one skinned draw call per fish or a bone-texture animation
 * system, to carry a mesh that is never seen closer than a few metres through
 * turbid water. Fish swim by passing a travelling wave down the body, which is
 * a closed-form displacement — so the whole animation is four lines of vertex
 * arithmetic on a hand-built silhouette, and the entire population is one
 * `InstancedMesh` and one draw call.
 *
 * Three ideas carry the module.
 *
 * **The body wave is the animation.** A carangiform swimmer's lateral
 * displacement is `a(s) sin(omega t - k s)` along the body axis `s`, with the
 * amplitude envelope `a` growing toward the tail — the nose barely moves and
 * the caudal fin sweeps about a tenth of a body length either side. That is
 * evaluated per vertex, and the normal is corrected by the analytic slope of
 * the same expression, so the body genuinely undulates instead of shearing
 * flat. Per-fish phase offsets desynchronise the school.
 *
 * **The school frame is CPU-side; everything inside it is GPU-side.** Each
 * school's circuit is a closed-form sum of sinusoids, so the CPU can evaluate
 * its centre, heading and bank for any `t` in a handful of trig calls — and,
 * crucially, can call `seafloorHeight` there. The floor clamp therefore uses
 * the *real* heightfield rather than a shader approximation of it, and only
 * three `vec4`s per school ever reach the GPU. Individual fish are placed as
 * offsets in that frame, weaving on their own phases, so the school has volume
 * and is not a rigid formation.
 *
 * **A school is not one behaviour.** The same closed-form machinery drives two
 * very different animals, because the difference between them is entirely in the
 * constants. An open-water shoal runs a two-hundred-metre circuit at cruise,
 * spread over thirty-four metres, holding a fixed depth below the surface. A
 * reef resident orbits a fixed piece of structure at a third of a metre a
 * second, packed into a third of the volume, and holds its depth above the
 * *floor* rather than below the surface — so it follows the bottom over an
 * outcrop instead of sliding across it. See `SCHOOL_LAYOUT`.
 *
 * **Nothing accumulates.** Every visible quantity is a pure function of the
 * clock: `resetClock(t)` and `update()`-ing to `t` produce a bit-identical
 * frame, which is what the visual regression harness requires. There is not a
 * single integrated velocity or remembered position anywhere in the file.
 *
 * That last point is also why the two GPU clocks are *phases* rather than
 * seconds. The other animated systems in this project push wrapped seconds into
 * a float32 uniform and take a discontinuity once an hour; here the CPU keeps
 * the clock in float64 and hands the shader `omega t mod 2pi`, with every
 * shader-side frequency an integer multiple of the fundamental. The wrap is
 * then exactly invisible — a sine does not care which turn it is on — and the
 * phase never grows large enough for `sin` to lose precision to range
 * reduction.
 *
 * Known limitation: the floor clamp is against the sand, not against the reef
 * outcrops `Props` scatters on it. A school can pass through a tall boulder.
 * Fixing that needs the prop transforms, which live in another module and would
 * couple the two for a collision the camera almost never sees side-on.

 *   `reef`    residents holding station over one patch of the reef — milling
 *             about a fixed piece of structure rather than travelling anywhere,
 *             and holding their depth above the floor rather than below the
 *             surface.
 *   `island`  the same behaviour, in the island's shallows.
 *   `patrol`  one wide, slow lap round the island, so its shelf has something
 *             crossing it as well as something sitting on it.
 *
 * Every fish in this project used to be in the first kind, on a circuit centred
 * on the world origin, which meant that the two places a viewer will
 * deliberately go and dive — the reef and the island — had nothing living over
 * them. This is a redistribution and not an increase: the tier counts are
 * untouched and the same fish are spread over more places worth finding.
 *
 * **The order is the priority**, and the interleaving is not decorative — see
 * `SCHOOL_ACTIVATION`. At the lowest populated tier only the first four schools
 * exist, so an order that put the four open-water shoals first would leave
 * Medium with exactly the empty reef this change is about.
 *
 * Ten is still a compile-time constant, so the per-school uniforms are chosen
 * with a `select` chain rather than a dynamically indexed array — legal on both
 * backends, but the kind of thing WebGL2 drivers have historically been bad at,
 * and the chain costs a few ternaries on a population whose entire vertex count
 * is under eleven thousand.

 * Shrinks a circuit until everywhere it can reach is deep enough, returning the

 * not academic: the island's shelf runs at a gradient of a fifth, so a school
 * orbiting twenty metres out from a station in nine metres of water can find
 * itself over the beach. The floor clamp's response to that is to collapse the
 * school's envelope and hold it three metres under mean sea level — inside the
 * hill, where nothing can see it and nothing reports it.
 *
 * What is probed is the whole annulus the school's *volume* can occupy, which is
 * the circuit plus its radial wander plus the school's own footprint. All three
 * matter, and the third is the one that was originally missed: the patrol's
 * centre stayed in eight metres of water for its whole lap while the corner of
 * its 26 x 14 m box reached ground the clamp measured at five, so the band
 * between floor and surface closed and the school flattened into a single
 * horizontal plane. That does not look like a bug, it looks like a decal, and it
 * survived a thirty-minute sweep of the circuit unnoticed until the half-extent
 * itself was asserted on.
 *
 * **The footprint is not scaled and the circuit is.** Shrinking a school's
 * circuit does not shrink the school; scaling all three together was the second
 * version of this function and it made the fit *stop working as it converged* —
 * by the time the scale reached a quarter, the probe was covering a fifth of the
 * ground the clamp would actually sample, so it reported clear water and left a
 * fourteen-percent squeeze behind it. Everything else about the search stayed
 * the same and the numbers did not move at all, which is what gave it away.
 *
 * Scaling both the radius and the wander is what makes this converge — shrinking
 * the radius alone leaves a wander that can be larger than the circuit it is
 * perturbing. The limit is the station itself, which `findStation` already
 * checked, so six steps of 0.7 always terminate somewhere acceptable.
