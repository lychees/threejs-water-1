 * A pirate's remains, half-buried in the sand.
 *
 * **Why this is built rather than downloaded.** Neither Poly Haven nor the CC0
 * end of Sketchfab publishes a weathered skeleton at a scale that would sit next
 * to 40k-triangle photogrammetry; what they do publish is low-poly stylised, and
 * next to the scans it reads as a different game. The shape is also unusually
 * tractable — a skull is a deformed sphere with two holes in it — so this
 * follows the route `Birds` and `Fish` already took for the same reason:
 * procedural geometry, animated from a clock so `resetClock(t)` reproduces a
 * frame exactly.
 *
 * It is one object, placed once: a single merged geometry and a single draw, so
 * it can afford 3,430 triangles on detail that only pays off when the camera is
 * a metre away — orbits, a tooth row, ribs that thin as they curve.
 *
 * No compute and no storage textures: the same node graph has to compile on the
 * WebGL2 fallback.
 *
 * This file used to hold a procedural coconut palm as well, and the grove that
 * scattered it. Both are gone. The palm was a good piece of engineering and a
 * bad tree — its fronds rode on `emissiveNode` to fake transmission, which is
 * neither shadowed nor tone-mapped with the rest of the scene, so under a clear
 * sky the whole grove came out chrome blue. `Props` plants two real palms in its
 * place; see `DRESSING_URLS` there.
