/**
 * Caching glTF loader.
 *
 * Three properties matter for this project:
 *
 *  - **Dedup.** `Ship` and `Props` are constructed in parallel from the same
 *    `AssetLoader`. Two concurrent `load()` calls for one URL must issue exactly
 *    one network fetch, so the cache stores the in-flight *promise*, not the
 *    resolved value.
 *  - **Isolation.** Callers get a `clone()` of the cached scene graph. Handing
 *    out the same `Group` twice would mean the second `scene.add()` silently
 *    reparents it away from the first. Clones share geometry and material, so
 *    the cost is a handful of `Object3D`s.
 *  - **Determinism.** Every GPU resource the loader creates is recorded, so
 *    `dispose()` frees the lot in one pass rather than relying on callers to
 *    traverse their own subtrees.
 *
 * Compression is configured defensively. The shipped dressing set uses Meshopt
 * geometry and KTX2 textures; the loader wires both decoders before first
 * request.
 *
 * **Draco is opt-in and is never probed for.** It used to auto-detect, HEAD-ing
 * three candidate paths before the first model could load — and since nothing
 * in this project has ever been Draco-encoded (`scripts/optimize-assets.mjs`
 * encodes Meshopt and contains the string zero times), all three always missed.
 * That cost three serial round trips on the critical boot path and put three
 * 404s in the console of every single session, which is not free: the test
 * suite asserts on console errors, so a probe that always fails was indistinguishable
 * from a real asset failure.
 *
 * The capability is kept for anyone who does serve a decoder — pass
 * `dracoDecoderPath` — because pointing at a CDN would add a third-party
 * runtime dependency to an otherwise self-contained build.
