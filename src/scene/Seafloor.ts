/**
 * Sandy seafloor.
 *
 * The heightfield is the one piece of geometry in this project that must exist
 * simultaneously on the CPU and the GPU: buoyancy and camera collision query it
 * per frame, the water surface reads it to decide how much of the shallow
 * turquoise to let through, and the floor mesh itself is displaced by it. If
 * those three disagree, the ship's shadow lands on water that is a different
 * colour from the sand underneath it.
 *
 * So the noise is deliberately *not* an analytic hash. `sin(dot(p, k)) * 43758`
 * hashes are chaotic by construction: a float32 GPU and a float64 CPU evaluate
 * them to completely different values, and the two representations of the floor
 * drift apart. Instead a single 256² byte texture of random values is generated
 * once and sampled with hand-written bilinear interpolation on both sides.
 * Unsigned-byte texels decode to exactly `n / 255` on every backend, so the two
 * evaluations agree to float32 rounding.
 *
 * Layout the field produces:
 *   - a shallow plateau (~17 m) around the origin, where the play area sits and
 *     the seafloor is meant to read through the water;
 *   - a shelf break falling to ~88 m in open water;
 *   - a second rise around the island, which breaks the surface.

 * rock on these centres and `Fish` stations its resident schools over them, and

 * finds coral finds fish, and a diver who follows fish arrives at coral. Two
 * independent scatters over the same annulus produce neither.
 *
 * A uniform scatter was the problem this replaces. The plateau's reef band is
 * about 210,000 m² and underwater visibility here runs to a few tens of metres,
 * so any even spread — at any instance count a frame can afford — is invisible
 * on average and the seabed reads as an empty plain. Gathering it into a handful
 * of patches with open sand between them is both what a reef actually looks like
 * and the only arrangement that puts something in front of the camera.
 *
 * Stratified by bearing, one patch per sector, for the same reason the fish
 * radii are: seven free angles leave a third of the compass empty about half the
 * time, and a viewer who swims the wrong way finds the plain again. Radii are
 * square-rooted so the patches spread evenly by area, and inset by the patch
 * radius so none hangs off the plateau into the drop.
 *
 * Memoised: it is a pure function of module constants, and both callers want the

 * surface is sampled at Nyquist and the normal cannot describe anything finer
 * than about a thirty-metre slope. Everything a viewer would call *terrain
 * texture* — the gullies, the scree, the broken ground — lives below that and had
 * nowhere to exist.
 *
 * The published fix is not more triangles. It is to evaluate more octaves at
 * shading rate and add their gradient to the normal, which is what iq's
 * `Rainforest` does with an fbm bump gated on `1 - |n.y|`. Two properties make it
 * the right trade here: the cost is per *pixel* rather than per vertex, so it
 * does not scale with the 4 km quad; and it changes nothing the CPU heightfield
 * has to agree with, so buoyancy, prop seating, the shoreline and the tour's
 * authored surf keys are all untouched.
 *
 * The range starts at octave 2 — inside what the mesh already carries — on
 * purpose. Those two octaves are where the visible faceting lives (53 m and 25 m
 * against a 15.6 m grid), and re-stating them at shading rate is what dissolves
