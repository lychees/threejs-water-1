/**
 * The submerged look, as a post-processing node graph.
 *
 * Three layers, composited in this order:
 *
 *   1. Beer–Lambert extinction along the view ray, per colour channel. Red is
 *      absorbed roughly five times faster than blue in sea water, and that
 *      asymmetry — not the fog colour itself — is what makes an image read as
 *      *underwater* rather than as a scene with blue fog in it.
 *   2. God rays: a screen-space radial accumulation from the projected sun,
 *      masked by the depth buffer so the shafts stop dead against near geometry
 *      (the hull) and only survive where the buffer is far away. The shaft
 *      source is striated with a noise field in polar coordinates around the
 *      sun, which is what gives the fan its individual blades.
 *   3. A blue-shifted grade with a depth-driven loss of saturation and contrast,
 *      standing in for the multiply-scattered light that fills the shadows.
 *
 * Everything cross-fades on `submersion`, and at `submersion === 0` the final
 * `mix` returns the input colour bit-for-bit, so a surface crossing is
 * continuous and the pass is free to stay in the chain permanently.
 *
 * The whole graph is built once. Every tunable is a uniform, including the
 * god-ray tap count (a dynamic loop bound, as `QualityManager.godRaySteps`
 * changes with the tier), so nothing here ever recompiles.
 *
 * Backend note: a post-processing pass is drawn with an internal fullscreen quad
 * and its own orthographic camera, so the built-in `cameraNear` / `cameraFar` /
 * `cameraProjectionMatrix` nodes would resolve to *that* camera, not the scene's.
 * The scene camera is therefore supplied explicitly via `setCamera`, and its
 * near/far and the projected sun position are pushed into uniforms each frame —
 * the same approach `PassNode` itself takes internally.

    // usable range against the 62 the preset claims.
