/**
 * Raymarched volumetric cloud layer.
 *
 * The layer is a **spherical shell** of procedural FBM density between
 * `altitude` and `altitude + thickness`, wrapped on a planet of `PLANET_RADIUS`.
 * That is what makes the deck converge into the horizon instead of stopping in a
 * band, and it is what bounds a grazing ray's crossing without a clamp. It is
 * rendered on a camera-locked dome: the dome only supplies view rays, the march
 * itself happens in world space, so the dome radius is unrelated to the cloud
 * altitude.
 *
 * Density is entirely procedural (`mx_fractal_noise_float`) — there is no 3D
 * noise texture to download and nothing to keep resident in VRAM. Coverage is
 * modulated by a 22 km weather field, so the sky has clear regions and dense
 * ones rather than one threshold over the whole hemisphere.
 *
 * Lighting is a short secondary march toward the sun for optical depth, resolved
 * through three **multiple-scattering** orders after Hillaire — each seeing less
 * extinction, contributing less energy and scattering more isotropically than
 * the last, which is what keeps a thick cloud's interior glowing instead of
 * going flat grey. The ambient is graded between the sea-facing base and the sky
 * the top sees. Compare ref-default.png (scattered cumulus) and ref-storm.png
 * (overcast).
 *
 * **Supported camera range.** Rays at or below the horizon are marched as
 * horizon rays (see `GRAZE_FLOOR`), so a camera *above* the layer cannot look
 * down through it correctly. Nothing in this project flies to 1400 m; if
 * something ever does, that floor is where to start.

 * "a shadow evaluated once per pixel can afford four; one evaluated inside
 * another raymarch cannot". This one is inside another raymarch — `LIGHT_STEPS`
 * samples at every one of `uSteps` steps — and it was taking the full seven
 * octaves, 72 times a pixel at High.
 *
 * **Worth 39% of the cloud layer**, 5.23 ms to 3.19, on a frame that was 12.31.
 * The layer is the single most expensive thing in the frame, so this is the
 * largest remaining lever that does not restructure anything.
 *
 * **It is a look change and was accepted as one**, on the pictures rather than
 * on the numbers. Nine of the twenty-one visual baselines moved and were
 * regenerated; `sunset` moved most, at mean dE94 0.284 against a 0.167 limit
 * with a peak of 46.9, because a low sun gives the longest path through the deck
 * and so the most integration for a coarser field to disagree about. Two of the
 * nine — `waterline` and `near-water-detail` — were inside their mean and pixel
 * limits and failed on p95 alone.
 *
 * What it costs is the fine structure of a cloud's *self-shadowing*. What it
 * does not cost is the silhouette, which still comes from the full field in the
 * outer march, and which is what the eye actually reads a cloud by. The reason
 * the interior survives coarsening is that this accumulates optical depth toward

 * uniform spacing all the way out, ending in a band with clear sky underneath
 * it. A real deck converges: puffs shrink and crowd together into the haze
 * because the layer is falling away with the curvature of the earth.
 *
 * Wrapping it on a sphere is eight lines and it bounds the crossing *naturally*,
 * which was the actual reason grazing rays were a problem in the first place.
 * The horizon crossing comes out around 15 km against the slab's clamped 7, and

 *
 * **1500 km, not the earth's 6371.** This is a free parameter and reinder picks

 * 1200 m a step through a 700 m layer at Medium. Adjacent pixels then land at
 * completely different heights *inside* the layer, so the vertical profile term
 * swings between them and the horizon band boils. `gallery-jitter` measured it:
 * far-field high-frequency energy at Medium went to 2.954 against a 2.33 ceiling,
 * while High — the same march at twice the steps — stayed inside its own.
 *
 * Capping the *integration* is not capping the geometry. The shell still curves,

 * stops is accumulating along a path whose far end the step count cannot resolve.
 * Seven thicknesses is past where the transmittance of anything worth drawing has
 * already closed, and it puts the horizon step at 400 m even at Medium.
 *
