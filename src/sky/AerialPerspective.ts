/**
 * One aerial perspective for the whole frame.
 *
 * Before this the scene had three unrelated treatments of distance haze and one
 * conspicuous absence. The ocean mixed toward an authored `fogColor` on a scalar
 * exponential; `VolumetricFog` is a *sea* fog, marched, and switched off in the
 * clear presets; and the terrain, the props, the ship and the canopy had
 * **nothing at all**. That last one is why the island had full foreground
 * contrast at 1.4 km and read as a cut-out laid over a hazy sea, and why the sea
 * and the land met at the shoreline as two different atmospheres.
 *
 * ### What it computes
 *
 * Extinction and inscatter as separate terms, which is the physically correct
 * split and the one `Xl2XRW` makes explicitly:
 *
 *     out = object * T + inscatter * (1 - T),   T = exp(-tau)
 *
 * `tau` is **per channel**. That is the whole point and it is what a scalar
 * density cannot do: air scatters blue about five times as strongly as red, so
 * distance moves a colour *toward the sky* rather than toward a grey constant.
 * The ratio comes from `Atmosphere`'s own Rayleigh and Mie coefficients rather
 * than from a hand-picked triple, so the haze cannot drift away from the dome
 * that produced it — which is what a horizon step is.
 *
 * The *magnitude* does not come from those coefficients, and that distinction is
 * worth stating plainly. Preetham's betaR is a per-metre coefficient against an
 * 8.4 km zenith column and a fitted appearance model on top; taken literally over
 * a 1.5 km horizontal path it gives about one percent extinction, which is not
 * what anyone means by aerial perspective. So the coefficients set the *hue* and
 * the preset's own `fog.density` sets the *strength* — a number already
 * calibrated per preset against the water, and now doing the same job everywhere.
 *
 * The vertical profile is the standard exponential atmosphere, integrated in
 * closed form along the ray:
 *
 *     ∫₀ᵈ exp(-(y₀ + t·rd.y)/H) dt = d · exp(-y₀/H) · (1 - exp(-k)) / k,  k = d·rd.y/H
 *
 * which is the same shape `MdGfzh` and `Nt3XDM` both use. It is singular at
 * `k = 0` — a horizontal ray — so near zero it falls back to the series, which
 * is exact to the term that matters and has no division at all.
 *
 * ### How it reaches the frame
 *
 * As `scene.fogNode`. Three calls it after lighting and after the material's own
 * output is resolved, for every material that has not opted out — so terrain,
 * props, ship, canopy, hull and water all receive the identical function with no
 * per-material plumbing. Materials that must not receive it (the sky dome, the
 * cloud layer, the underwater dressing) already set `fog = false` for their own
 * reasons.
 *
 * Underwater is gated rather than opted out, because the seafloor is one mesh
 * that crosses the waterline: air haze applies where both the camera and the
 * shaded point are above the surface, and the water's own transmission owns
 * everything else.
 */

/**
 * Scale height of the haze layer, metres.
 *
 * Not the 8.4 km of the Rayleigh column. What actually hazes a view across a

 * — which is a kilometre deep at most and is why a summit stands clear of the
 * murk its own beach sits in.
