/**
 * Looping noise buffers. Every continuous layer in the ambience is filtered
 * noise, and all of it is drawn from one of these.
 *
 * **Buffers, not an `AudioWorklet`.** A worklet would produce genuinely endless
 * noise with no loop at all, but it has to be loaded from a separate module URL
 * at runtime: a second artefact to bundle, a path that has to survive whatever
 * base URL the site is deployed under, and a failure mode where the ambience is
 * silently missing on exactly the deployment nobody tested. A pre-filled
 * `AudioBuffer` is a `Float32Array` and nothing else — it cannot fail to load,
 * and it works identically under a test harness with no network.
 *
 * **The loop seam is folded, not spliced.** Butting the end of a buffer against
 * its start leaves a step discontinuity, which is a click. White noise is full of
 * steps so it survives, but the brown noise the underwater rumble uses is a
 * low-frequency signal whose endpoints are far apart, and there the splice is a
 * thud once per loop. So the generator runs `length + fade` samples and folds the
 * overrun back over the head with an equal-power crossfade: sample 0 becomes the
 * natural continuation of sample `length - 1`, and the loop point stops existing.
 * Equal-power (sin/cos) rather than linear, because the two ends are uncorrelated
 * noise — a linear crossfade of uncorrelated signals dips 3 dB in the middle,
 * which for a bed that loops every few seconds is an audible periodic sag.
 *
 * **Loop period.** Four seconds of noise repeats, and a listener who is paying
 * attention can hear that repeat as a texture. Two things hide it and neither is
 * a fix: every bed plays the shared buffer at a different rate and from a
 * different offset, so no two layers ever repeat together, and the layers'
 * amplitude modulation is CPU-side on periods that have nothing to do with the
 * buffer length. Making the buffer longer trades memory for a longer tell; 4 s at
 * 48 kHz is 768 KB per buffer, and two buffers is the point where the cost stops
 * being free.
 *
 * **Seeded.** Same reason every other procedural system in this project is: a
 * capture harness that mutes the audio still constructs it, and construction that
 * called `Math.random()` would allocate a different buffer every run for no
 * benefit whatsoever.
