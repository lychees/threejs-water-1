/**
 * The scene's ambience, synthesised rather than sampled.
 *
 * There is no reliably-licensed CC0 ocean or wind recording this project could
 * fetch reproducibly — and the licensing is the smaller half of the argument. A
 * recording is a photograph of one sea. This scene changes wind speed, wave
 * height, rain rate, hull speed and submersion *live and continuously*, from a
 * slider the viewer is holding, and a fixed loop can only be cross-faded between:
 * which is audible as exactly what it is, two seas playing at once, each still
 * describing the wind it was recorded in. Filtered noise whose band and level
 * *are* functions of the wind speed has no such seam, because there is nothing to
 * cross-fade — there is one sea and the wind speed is a term in it. That is also
 * how a parameterised sea is actually built; sample libraries are for sounds that
 * do not have a parameter.
 *
 * The layers, and what drives each:
 *
 *  - **Surf.** Low-passed noise, level linear in wind speed and band opening with
 *    it, breathing on the swell period implied by the peak wavelength.
 *  - **Wind.** A separate, higher band that climbs far faster than the sea does,
 *    plus an aeolian tone off the rigging once it is blowing hard enough to sing.
 *  - **Rain.** Denser and brighter than the wind, with a separate hiss layer and a
 *    low drumming that only appears in a downpour.
 *  - **Hull.** Bow wash and the rush along the side, from hull speed.
 *  - **Underwater.** Not a switch: `submersion` continuously ducks and closes a
 *    low-pass over everything above, brings up a rumble, and starts entraining
 *    bubbles.
 *  - **Gulls.** The one thing in here that is alive, and the only layer that is
 *    not continuous: a synthesised cry, scheduled in sparse flurries against the
 *    flock the renderer is actually drawing, silent under water and thinned out
 *    by rain and by a gale.
 *
 * Three constraints shaped the implementation more than the sound design did.
 *
 * **Autoplay.** An `AudioContext` may not start before a user gesture. This one
 * is constructed and then explicitly suspended, its master gain is pinned at zero
 * until `resume()` has been called from a gesture, and if the platform has no Web
 * Audio at all every method here is a no-op that returns rather than throwing.
 * Audio is the one subsystem that must never be able to take the frame down.
 *
 * **`update` allocates nothing.** It runs on the render loop. Every node exists
 * from construction, every parameter write goes through a `ParamTarget` that
 * smooths, dedupes and drops non-finite values, and the layer model is plain
 * arithmetic on preallocated fields. One-shots do allocate — a source node cannot
 * be restarted, so an event has to build its voice — but they are events, not
 * frames, and the voice count is capped per tier so a storm cannot turn into an
 * allocation storm.
 *
 * **Silence has to be free.** Under the capture harness this is muted for the
 * whole run. Muted, and while the context is not running, no parameter is written
 * at all: the model still advances so `resetClock` means something, but nothing
 * touches the audio thread. That is not only cheaper, it removes any path by which
 * scheduling audio could perturb the frame timing of a measurement.

 * the previous note's, which is what makes appending safe.
 *
 * The pitch contour has three parts and they are the whole difference between a
 * bird and a beep:
 *
 *  - **The scoop.** The note enters a fourth low and reaches pitch in its first
 *    fifth. The air pulse that makes the sound also has to spin the syrinx up;
 *    starting on pitch is the sound of an oscillator being switched on.
 *  - **The waver.** Two small, unequal excursions across the held body, drawn
 *    rather than fixed so no two notes wobble identically. A dead-steady pitch
 *    under a stack this rich is unmistakably synthetic.
 *  - **The glide.** The last two fifths fall by about a third. This is the part
 *    a person imitating a gull would produce, and it is the bill closing — which
 *    is why the formant is dragged down with it rather than held.
 *
 * The amplitude holds before it falls, and starts falling *before* the glide
 * does. A note that decays from its attack is plucked, and plucked is a
 * different family of sound entirely; a gull leans on the note.
