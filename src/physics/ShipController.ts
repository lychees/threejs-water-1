/**
 * Throttle and rudder for the hero ship.
 *
 * The controller never writes a position or a heading. It resolves the driver's
 * intent into a force and a yaw torque and hands those to the buoyancy solver,
 * which integrates them alongside gravity, flotation and the wave response. That
 * is the difference between a hull that climbs a swell and loses way doing it,
 * and one that slides along a wave field as though it were painted on.
 *
 * The forces are the ones that actually decide how a displacement hull feels:
 *
 *   thrust      along the bow, from throttle
 *   drag        opposing motion, quadratic — this is what sets top speed, not a
 *               clamp, so the hull accelerates onto its maximum and settles
 *   lateral     the keel. Water resists sideways motion an order of magnitude
 *               harder than forward motion, and that asymmetry is most of why a
 *               boat feels like a boat: it carves rather than skidding, and it
 *               keeps carrying way through a turn
 *   yaw         rudder torque scaled by speed, because a rudder is a foil and a
 *               stationary rudder does nothing
 *   yaw damping resistance to spinning, so the turn settles instead of winding up

 * Where the hull stops, and why it is a depth rather than a fence.

 * twice over: it is invisible in a world that otherwise explains itself, and it
 * is a *circle* on a coastline that is deliberately not one — the shore runs from

 * out to sea on the bays or inland on the headland. It would also do nothing
 * about the reef, which is the other place a hull has no business being.
 *
 * So the boundary is the seabed. `dutch_ship_medium` floats with about 3.4 m
 * under her, and a hull is in trouble well before the keel touches: 7 m is where
 * a ship this size starts sounding and turning away, which is the behaviour to
 * reproduce. Below that the water pushes back, and it pushes *down the depth
