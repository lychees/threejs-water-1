     * the 24 km ocean disc in `OceanMesh` requires and which therefore cannot
     * come in — the near plane is the only lever there is. At 0.1 the depth
     * buffer resolved 1.17 m at the island, 1.4 km out, and 54 cm at the
     * `ISLAND_STAND_OFF` the tour keeps. Two nearly coplanar surfaces at that
     * range separated by less than one depth code is a shoreline: the seafloor
     * heightfield breaks the surface there and the water writes depth, so the
     * two meet at a grazing angle inside the quantum. 0.5 divides all of it by
     * five, for one number and no format change.
     *
     * **It stays at 0.1 anyway, and the reason is worth recording because the
     * obvious argument for moving it is wrong.**
     *
     * The plan was 0.5, on the reasoning that `OceanMesh.innerRadius` is 0.6 m
     * so nothing of the sea lives closer. That is a misreading of the mesh:
     * `buildRadialGrid` fans from a *centre vertex at radius zero* out to the
     * first ring, so the surface reaches the lens no matter what the inner
     * radius says. The grid is re-centred on the camera every frame, so what a
     * near plane of `n` removes is a disc of water of radius roughly `n`
     * directly under the viewer. At 0.1 that is a 10 cm hole nobody will find;
     * at 0.5 it is half a metre, and the shot that finds it is already in the
     * gallery — `waterline` sits the eye 2 cm above the surface, which is
     * exactly the case where that disc fills the bottom of frame and the
     * per-pixel waterline has nothing left to resolve against.
     *
     * The underwater particle boxes and the rain field have no exclusion radius
     * either, so they would start popping at half a metre as well.
     *
     * The precision is a real problem and this is not the lever for it. The
     * lever is `reversedDepthBuffer`, which r185 supports and which would give
     * 0.16 mm at the island against the 1.17 m above — every depth consumer here
     * goes through `perspectiveDepthToViewZ` or `linearDepth` and both branch on
     * it, so it is genuinely a one-flag change. What stops it being taken here is
     * that the WebGL2 backend silently reverts without `EXT_clip_control`, which
     * would leave the two backends resolving depth differently, and that is a
     * commitment to make deliberately rather than at the end of a batch.

     * thing: the sun in the default preset sits at azimuth 137.5 degrees and 26
     * degrees elevation, so that bearing pointed the camera 43 degrees *into* the
     * light. The sea's near faces were turned away from it, the hull the orbit
     * rig targets was a flat silhouette, and the island — which is 1.4 km out on
     * a bearing of 236 degrees — sat 56 degrees off axis, reduced to a smudge at
     * the very edge of frame. The first thing a visitor saw was a dark seascape
     * with a black cut-out in it.

     * 250 degrees puts the sun 113 degrees off the view axis: behind the camera's
     * shoulder, so the hull and the swell faces are lit and modelled rather than
     * silhouetted, while enough of the specular path stays in frame that the
