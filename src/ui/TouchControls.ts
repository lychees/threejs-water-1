/**
 * On-screen throttle and rudder for touch devices.
 *
 * Boat mode is driven with W/S and A/D, which a phone does not have. This is the
 * same two axes as a thumbstick: push forward for ahead, pull back for astern,
 * left and right for rudder. It writes into `ShipController.setInput`, the same
 * entry point the keyboard resolves to, so there is one place where throttle and
 * rudder become forces and no second control path to keep in step.
 *
 * Shown only when there is a coarse pointer *and* Boat mode is selected. A mouse
 * user already has better controls and a stick over the frame would only be in
 * the way; a touch user in Orbit mode is panning the camera and would find a
 * stick that steers a ship they are not driving actively confusing.
 *
 * Pointer Events rather than Touch Events, so the same code serves a stylus, a
 * touchscreen and a mouse — which also makes it drivable from a test.
