/**
 * Screen-space reflection for the ocean surface.
 *
 * ## Why this exists alongside the planar reflector
 *
 * `ocean/Reflections` argues, correctly, that a mirrored camera is exact for a
 * plane and that SSR cannot reflect what is off-screen. Both statements are
 * true. What the argument misses is that *the ocean is not a plane*. The surface
 * is displaced by three cascades of FFT waves, so a reflection mirrored about
 * y = 0 is only right where the water happens to be at mean level and pointing
 * straight up. Everywhere else — which is most of a rough sea — the mirrored
 * image is sampled at the wrong place and merely wobbled toward plausibility by
 * a normal-driven uv offset. That offset is a fudge with no geometry behind it,
 * and it is what reads as "odd": the reflection slides across wave faces instead
 * of being attached to them, and it is systematically wrong in the same
 * direction on every crest.
 *
 * SSR has the opposite error profile. It traces the *actual* reflected ray
 * against the *actual* depth buffer, so a reflection that lands on a wave face
 * lands where the ray says it should, and it stays there as the wave moves under
 * it. What SSR cannot do is invent geometry that is not on screen.
 *
 * The two therefore compose rather than compete, and that is how this module is
 * meant to be used: **pass the planar reflection (or the analytic sky) in as
 * `fallback`.** SSR takes over wherever it is confident and hands back smoothly
 * wherever it is not. That layering — screen-space trace over a coarser but
 * always-available source — is what Frostbite and Unreal both do, and for the
 * same reason: neither source is complete on its own.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a post pass
 *
 * The water is a forward-rendered transparent material. It draws *after* the
 * opaque scene, which means two things, and both of them are gifts:
 *
 *   1. The opaque colour and depth are already available to it, via
 *      `viewportSharedTexture()` and `viewportDepthTexture()` — the same two
 *      buffers `OceanMaterial` already reads for refraction. There is no
 *      G-buffer to build and no extra pass to schedule.
 *   2. **The water is not in the depth buffer it traces against.** Every SSR
 *      implementation that runs as a post pass has to bias the ray origin off
 *      the surface to stop it hitting the pixel it started from; that bias is a
 *      constant tuned against self-intersection at one end and detached contacts
 *      at the other, and it is a permanent source of artefacts. Here the problem
 *      does not exist: at the ray's origin the depth buffer holds the seafloor,
 *      metres further away, so the very first sample cannot be a false hit and
 *      no bias is needed at all.
 *
 * The cost of running in-material is that the trace happens per water fragment
 * at full resolution with no chance of temporal reuse or denoising. That rules
 * out the stochastic/GGX second-generation approach (Stachowiak, "Stochastic
 * Screen-Space Reflections", SIGGRAPH 2015), which is only viable behind a
 * temporal filter. This is a single mirror ray per pixel — first-generation SSR
 * — which is the right shape for a near-mirror surface anyway: water at
 * roughness 0.075 has a reflection lobe narrow enough that one ray is close to
 * the correct answer.
 *
 * ## The march
 *
 * Stepping happens in **screen space with perspective-correct depth**, after
 * Morgan McGuire and Michael Mara, "Efficient GPU Screen-Space Ray Tracing"
 * (JCGT 3(4), 2014). The two endpoints of the ray are projected to clip space;
 * the segment between their screen positions is walked with uniform steps, and
 * the ray's view distance is recovered at each step by interpolating **1/w**
 * linearly along that segment — which is exact, because reciprocal depth is the
 * quantity that is affine in screen space under a perspective projection.
 *
 * The alternative — advancing by a fixed number of metres in view space and
 * projecting each sample — is what most short SSR implementations do, and it is
 * wrong in a way that matters here. Uniform world steps project to wildly
 * non-uniform screen steps: near the camera each step jumps tens of pixels and
 * walks straight over thin geometry, while far away a dozen consecutive samples
 * land in the same texel and are pure waste. On an ocean, where the reflected
 * ray is often near-grazing and covers hundreds of metres for a handful of
 * pixels, that mismatch is severe. Uniform *screen* steps spend the budget where
 * the data actually is: one step, roughly one span of the depth buffer.
 *
 * The screen segment is additionally clipped to the viewport before the budget
 * is divided up, so a ray that leaves the frame after a fifth of its length
 * spends all its steps inside the frame rather than four fifths of them
 * sampling nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* implemented: hierarchical (Hi-Z) tracing, per Uludag,
 * "Hi-Z Screen-Space Cone-Traced Reflections" (GPU Pro 5, 2014). Hi-Z is the
 * right answer when rays are long, numerous and unbounded, because it turns a
 * linear march into a logarithmic one. It needs a min-depth mip pyramid built
 * over the depth buffer every frame, which here would mean an extra pass and an
 * extra full-resolution target to serve a march that is already capped at a few
 * dozen taps on a surface covering part of the screen. The pyramid would cost
 * more than the march it accelerates.
 *
 * ## Fades
 *
 * Everything below is about the same thing: a screen-space trace is an
 * approximation with a sharply defined domain, and every boundary of that domain
 * has to be crossed smoothly or it shows up as a moving edge in the image. The
 * confidence returned by the trace is the product of five terms — screen edge,
 * ray-toward-camera, range, surface facing, and the coarse hit flag — and the
 * result is mixed toward `fallback` by it. A hard cut to the fallback is worse
 * than having no SSR at all, because the eye tracks discontinuities far more
 * readily than it tracks a slightly wrong reflection.
 *
 * ## Backends
 *
 * Compiles on WebGL2. It should not be *enabled* there: the depth-buffer read is
 * the least portable thing the surface does, which is exactly why
 * `QualityManager` already disables refraction on that path. Call
 * `setQuality( 0 )` and the whole graph collapses to one uniform compare and the
 * fallback, at no bandwidth cost.
