 * Spectral ocean surface.

 *   1. evolve   h0(k) -> h(k, t) and derive four packed complex spectra
 *   2. IFFT     log2(N) horizontal + log2(N) vertical butterfly passes, x2 pairs
 *   3. assemble unpack into a displacement texture and a derivative texture
 *
 * Field packing across the two complex slots of two RGBA ping-pong pairs
 * (8 real fields, all used):
 *
 *   A.c0 -> real: Dy (height)          imag: dDx/dz
 *   A.c1 -> real: Dx                   imag: Dz
 *   B.c0 -> real: dDy/dx               imag: dDy/dz
 *   B.c1 -> real: dDx/dx               imag: dDz/dz
 *
 * Packing two real fields into one complex transform halves the pass count: an
 * IFFT of (P + iQ) for real P and Q returns P in the real component and Q in the
 * imaginary one. The cross term dDx/dz is carried so the foam mask can use a
 * true Jacobian rather than the usual diagonal-only approximation, which
 * under-reports folding on obliquely travelling crests.

/**
 * Output targets are sampled at arbitrary world scale by the surface shader, so
 * a 16 m tile can span far less than a pixel at distance. Without a mip chain
 * that undersampling shows up as a shimmering speckle across the whole mid-field
 * — by far the most visible artefact on a moving ocean. Trilinear filtering over
 * generated mips lets the GPU pick the right level per pixel.
 *
 * `anisotropy = 1` is deliberate, and it is the opposite of the usual advice.
 *
 * Measured, on the far-field band under the horizon at High (mean |laplacian|,
 * `tests/gallery-jitter.spec.ts`): anisotropy 16 -> 6.80, 4 -> 6.28, 2 -> 5.01,
 * 1 -> 3.52. Monotonic, and the wrong way round from the usual expectation.
 *
 * The reason is not that anisotropic filtering under-samples. It does not: the
 * reference algorithm takes N = min(ceil(Pmax/Pmin), maxAniso) samples at
 * LOD = log2(Pmax/N), so a tap budget too small for the footprint is compensated
 * by choosing a coarser level, and the footprint is covered either way.
 *
 * The reason is that this is a *slope* field feeding a nonlinear shading model,
 * and filtering does not commute with it. Anisotropic filtering delivers a
 * better estimate of the mean slope over the footprint — and the mean slope is
 * the wrong thing to shade. Specular response is a sharply nonlinear function of
 * slope, so the correct answer is the mean of the shaded facets, not the shading
 * of the mean facet, and a higher tap count buys accuracy in exactly the
 * quantity that is not wanted. What it costs is the four levels of extra
 * sharpness it takes in exchange, which is retained slope variance the shading
 * then turns into noise.
 *
 * Dropping to 1 makes the hardware choose the major-axis level, which carries
 * less of that variance. It is a real trade and not a free win — detail along
 * the well-resolved minor axis goes with it — and it is the right side of the
 * trade for water seen from near its own surface, where the footprint is a
 * fraction of a metre across and tens of metres long. The alpha channel below
 * addresses the same mismatch from the other end, by carrying the variance
 * forward instead of discarding it.
