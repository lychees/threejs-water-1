/**
 * Cooley–Tukey radix-2 IFFT executed as ping-ponged fullscreen passes.
 *
 * Deliberately fragment-based rather than compute-based: Three's WebGL2 backend
 * has no compute shaders and no storage textures, so a compute implementation
 * would need an entirely separate fallback path. Fragment passes compile to both
 * backends from one TSL source. At the sizes we run (<= 512^2, ~9 passes per
 * direction) the cost difference is not the bottleneck — the surface shading is.
 *
 * Each texel carries TWO independent complex values (rg and ba), so one pass
 * transforms two spectra at once. Four spectra per cascade therefore need two
 * ping-pong pairs rather than four.
 *
 * Reference: J. Tessendorf, "Simulating Ocean Water" (SIGGRAPH course notes);
 * butterfly-texture formulation after Flügge, "Realtime GPGPU FFT Ocean Water
 * Simulation" (2017). Implementation here is original.

/**
 * Builds the node graph for one butterfly pass. `direction` 0 = horizontal
 * (transform along x), 1 = vertical.
 *
 * **Every cascade's spectra live side by side in one atlas**, `slots` columns
 * of `size` across — slot `2c` is cascade c's pair A and slot `2c + 1` its pair
 * B — and one pass steps all of them. That is a
 * performance change with no effect on the mathematics: every slot is an
 * independent transform of identical size reading the same butterfly row at the
 * same stage, and the butterfly reads nothing cascade-specific at all, so
 * running them separately paid the per-pass cost once per slot for one pass of
 * work.
 *
 * Measured, that cost is the whole story. A fullscreen pass costs about 53
 * microseconds in this engine near enough regardless of what it draws — 96 extra
 * passes measured 5.09 ms — and the transform issues 108 of them, which is the
 * 5.7 ms the frame's CPU update phase loses when the simulation is stubbed. It
 * is command submission, not arithmetic on 65 000 texels, so halving the pass
 * count is worth close to half the transform.
 *
 * An atlas rather than a multiple-render-target, and that is not a preference:
 * MRT was tried first and silently wrote nothing here — attachments left at
 * their clear value, no validation error, and a constant `vec4` failing exactly
 * as the real graph did. The atlas needs no capability beyond a wider texture.
