      // itself undersampled, so in the far field it reports a large number
      // because the wave, not the noise, moved.

      // --- shore break ---------------------------------------------------------

      // The single largest thing missing from the shoreline: waves arrived at the
      // beach and simply stopped, with no surf at all, because every foam term
      // above is driven by the *surface* — the Jacobian fold and the wake buffer
      // — and neither knows the seabed is there. A wave does not break because it
      // steepened; it breaks because it ran out of water.
      //
      // So this is driven by depth. Three things have to be right, and the first
      // attempt got only the first of them.
      //
      // **Where it breaks.** McCowan's criterion puts the break where the depth
      // falls to about 1.3 wave heights, so the surf line walks seaward as the
      // sea gets up — which is what makes a shore read as the same shore in a
      // calm and in a blow. The wave height to use is *not* `uWaveScale`: that is
      // Pierson-Moskowitz significant height for a fully developed sea, which at
      // this preset's 15 m/s is 5.5 m, and 1.3 times that put the break line in
      // eight metres of water. The whole lagoon came out solid white. What breaks
      // on a beach is the swell that reaches it, which here is nearer 1.5 m, so
      // the height is taken as a fraction of the sea state rather than as the
      // sea state.
      //
      // **That it is a band, not a region.** Everything shallower than the break
      // depth is not white; the strip *at* the break is. A parabola in normalised
      // depth peaks a third of the way in and returns to zero at both ends, which
      // gives a line of white with clear water outside it and a lull behind it.
      //
      // **That it has gaps.** Real surf arrives in groups — the spectrum is
      // narrow-banded, so the envelope beats and the beach gets three or four big
