/**
 * Planar reflection of the scene in the water surface.
 *
 * The surface previously reflected `mix(horizonColor, skyColor, reflectDir.y)` —
 * a two-colour analytic gradient. It is a reasonable stand-in for open ocean
 * under an empty sky and it is completely wrong the moment anything is *on* the
 * water: a ship sitting in a mirror that does not contain it reads as pasted on,
 * and no amount of Fresnel tuning fixes that.
 *
 * **Planar, not screen-space.** SSR can only reflect what is already on screen,
 * and the geometry that matters here is the hull — which, seen from a low camera,
 * has its reflection below the waterline while the object itself is near the top
 * of the frame or out of it entirely. That is precisely the case SSR cannot
 * serve. A mirrored camera has the whole scene available, and the ocean is a
 * plane, which is the one situation where planar reflection is exactly right
 * rather than an approximation.
 *
 * The cost is a second view of the scene. It is charged only where it buys
 * something: see `setQuality`.

   * `resolutionScale` is the real lever. The reflection is sampled through a
   * surface normal that is being perturbed by every ripple in the wave field, so
   * it is never seen sharp — half resolution is indistinguishable from full in
   * motion, and a quarter is acceptable wherever the sea state is rough enough
   * to break the image up anyway.
   *
   * This was latched shut for a while — honoured once at boot and ignored after
   * — because resizing a mipmapped target during a tier change crashed the
   * renderer: the reflector renders the whole scene from its own `updateBefore`,
   * so it reached node graphs three had not finished rebuilding. The latch
   * treated the symptom. The cause was that a tier change destroyed resources
   * still referenced by a submitted command buffer, and it is now fixed where it
   * belongs — `App.drainQualityRequests` pauses the loop, joins the frame in
   * flight, fences on `onSubmittedWorkDone`, and only then applies the tier. With
   * the GPU provably idle there is nothing left for the latch to protect, and
   * someone who starts on Low and switches to Max gets the reflection they paid
   * for instead of a quarter-resolution one.
   *
   * Dropping the old targets is the point rather than a side effect. `reflector`
   * keys its targets by camera, and changing `resolutionScale` alone leaves the
   * existing entry at its old size, so the scale would apply only to a camera
   * the reflector had not seen before — which, in a session with one camera, is
   * never.
