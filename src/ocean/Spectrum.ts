/**
 * The three bands, and why each tile is the size it is.
 *
 * A cascade of `N` texels over an `L`-metre tile carries wavenumbers on a grid
 * of spacing `2pi/L` out to `pi N / L`. In wavelengths that is a well-resolved
 * range of roughly `[2L/N, L/4]`: below `2L/N` the mode does not exist at all,
 * and above `L/4` the band is described by a disc only a few texels across, so
 * its directional content is quantised into a handful of headings. A band that
 * sits outside its own tile's range is not an error the code can report — it
 * simply renders less sea than the spectrum was asked for — so the tiles are
 * chosen against the bands rather than the other way round.
 *
 * At the tiers' resolutions (N = 128 / 256 / 512) the well-resolved ranges are:
 *
 *   L = 1024   [16, 256] m at N=128,  [4, 256] m at N=512
 *   L =  128   [ 2,  32] m at N=128,  [0.5, 32] m at N=512
 *   L =    8   [0.125, 2] m at N=128, [0.03, 2] m at N=512
 *
 * **The swell tile was 512 m and is now 1024.** Two things improve at once and
 * neither costs anything: the dominant sea repeats at twice the distance, which
 * is the tiling a wide shot actually shows, and the band occupies a disc of
 * radius 43 texels instead of 21 — four times the modes, on the same grid, for
 * the part of the spectrum carrying nearly all the energy. Nothing is lost at
 * the short end because the band stops at 24 m and the tile still resolves to
 * 4 m.
 *
 * **The 3-6 m octave stayed in the ripple cascade, and that is also measured.**
 * Moving it up to the chop cascade is attractive on paper: at the top of a 16 m
 * tile a 6 m wave is a disc of radius 2.7 texels with its heading quantised into
 * a handful of spokes, where on the 128 m tile it would have a radius of 42 and
 * a real spectrum. What that ignores is which cascades a tier actually runs.
 * Medium enables two of the three, so the ripple cascade is off there and those
 * wavelengths are simply not rendered — moving them into a cascade Medium *does*
 * run hands that tier a whole octave of short waves it never had, and
 * `gallery-jitter` measured the result at 2.352 against its 2.33 far-field
 * ceiling. Detail a tier cannot resolve is not detail; it is shimmer.
 *
 * **The ripple tile stayed at 16 m too, and for a similar reason.** It was
 * halved to 8, on the reasoning that the band asked for 5 cm
 * from a grid whose finest mode is 6.25 cm at the top tier — so the shortest
 * waves in the spectrum were never rendered anywhere. Halving the tile does fix
 * that, and it also quarters the number of modes in the 1-3 m annulus, which at
 * the High tier's 256 texels means 49 modes where there were 197. Those are the
 * waves that fold, and `tests/foam.spec.ts` caught it immediately: whitecap
 * coverage at 9 m/s fell from inside its factor-of-three band around Monahan to
 * a fifth of the prediction, because the same energy in a quarter of the modes
 * makes fewer, larger folds rather than many small ones.
 *
 * The honest way to finer ripples is to give this cascade more texels than the
 * other two, which is what the reference product does. That is not available
 * here: the three cascades share one spectrum atlas and one set of butterfly
 * passes — deliberately, and recently, for the performance it buys — so raising
 * one raises all three and costs 4x the transform. The band edge below is
 * therefore left at the value the spectrum wants rather than the value the grid
 * can reach, and the gap is a known limit rather than a bug.
