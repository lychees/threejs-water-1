   * Concentric rings in the radial ocean grid. The single strongest lever on
   * surface fidelity: vertex spacing scales as radius / meshRings, and a cascade
   * can only displace geometry out to where its wavelength still exceeds that
   * spacing.
   *
   * **It is the worse of the two mesh axes that pulls that lever**, and these
   * pairs were re-proportioned on that basis. Radial spacing is
   * `exp(ln(24000/0.6) / meshRings) - 1` per metre of distance and angular is
   * `2*pi / meshSegments`; a wave survives displacement only if both resolve it,
   * so the coarser axis governs and over-sampling the finer one is vertex budget
   * spent on nothing. Every tier was previously 2.6 to 3.4 times out of square in
   * the same direction — far too many segments, far too few rings.
   *
   * They are now square to within 0.3%, which buys a 1.6x shorter surviving
   * wavelength at every distance and every tier. See `squareGrid` in
   * `ocean/meshSampling`, which derives them, and the test that pins them.
   *
   * **What that does not buy is a quieter image, and it was expected to.**
   * Measured across three trees, squaring recovers about 2% of the near-field
   * detail the vertex band-limit costs — nothing — while raising far-field
   * shimmer 5-7% and temporal change 8-10% on High, Ultra and Max. The reason is
   * that a finer mesh makes the band-limit remove *less*: `cascadeReach` fades a
   * cascade at a distance inversely proportional to vertex spacing, so this moves
   * High's ripple fade from 40-80 m out to 65-131 m. The extra energy is wave
   * geometry genuinely carried further, not noise — which is a distinction
   * `gallery-jitter` cannot draw. Re-measure with `tests/gallery-jitter.spec.ts`,
   * which produced every figure above.
   *
   * It is very slightly *cheaper*, not free: trading segments for rings at a
   * fixed `rings * segments` lowers both the true vertex count `(R+1)*S + 1` and
   * the triangle count `S*(2R+1)` by 0.1% to 0.5%.
   *
   * What it spends is the horizon ring's smoothness. At High the outer ring is a
   * 275-gon rather than a 448-gon, and at 24 km its chord sags 1.57 m — which
   * subtends 6.5e-5 rad, against 9.7e-4 rad for one pixel at 720 lines over a 40
   * degree vertical field. Fifteen times under a pixel, from any camera height.
