/**
 * What the lens does when the camera goes under the water and comes back.
 *
 * CPU-only, for the same reason `fft.spec` is: the thing that decides this
 * behaviour is a handful of scalars updated on the CPU, and the shader below
 * them is a pure function of the uniforms they write. Asserting on the uniforms
 * is therefore asserting on what is drawn, without a GPU in the loop.
 *
 * **Three defects are pinned here, all of them observed rather than imagined.**
 *
 *   1. Surfacing was detected as a single-frame *edge* — `submersion` falling
 *      from above 0.5 to below 0.05 between two consecutive updates. That is
 *      0.315 m of a 0.7 m band in one step, so a camera rising at 10.5 m/s did
 *      not trigger it and nothing but a teleport ever did. Measured: a 60-frame
 *      ascent through the surface left the lens completely dry.
 *   2. When it *did* fire it set the rain coverage to 1 — the storm maximum —
 *      so a dunk on a cloudless day put a full downpour on the glass.
 *   3. And then dried it on the rain constant, which is 7.5 s: still visibly
 *      wet 15 s later, effectively clear only after 30.
 *
 * The replacement is a film that charges while the lens is under water and
 * drains when it is not, with no edge test anywhere.
