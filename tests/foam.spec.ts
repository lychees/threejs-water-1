/**
 * Rendered whitecap coverage, against the law that is supposed to generate it.
 *
 * The deposit rate follows Monahan & O'Muircheartaigh's fit to ship
 * observations, `W = 3.84e-6 * U^3.41` — and until this existed, nothing checked
 * what came out. The law was decorating a system whose actual coverage was an
 * order of magnitude higher than it predicts, which is why the reference image
 * rendered a 15 m/s sea as a sheet of white.
 *
 * Measured from the accumulation buffer rather than from the frame. A rendered
 * pixel is white for several reasons — sun glitter, sky reflection, a blown
 * highlight on a crest — and none of them are foam; the buffer's red channel is
 * the foam field itself, so counting it answers the question that was asked.
