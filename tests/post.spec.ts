/**
 * The post chain's four image stages: grade, bloom, depth of field, lens flare.
 *
 * These are behavioural rather than pictorial on purpose. What a graded frame
 * *looks* like is the visual suite's job, and it answers it by comparing whole
 * images against a baseline. What this file asks is narrower and cannot be
 * answered that way: is the stage actually in the chain, does its one defining
 * property hold, and does turning it off genuinely turn it off. A baseline
 * comparison passes just as happily against a stage that was never wired in —
 * it only knows the image changed, not which of five things changed it.
 *
 * Every test here pins a camera and calls `resetDeterministic` before measuring,
 * for the reason the shot list's own header gives: without it a measurement
 * depends on whatever the previous test left behind.
