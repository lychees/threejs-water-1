     * bundled DXC will not load. Falling back to FXC on the same D3D12 backend
     * brings the device up, and is harmless where DXC does load.
     *
     * `--enable-features=Vulkan` was removed: on Windows the backend is D3D12,
     * and asking for Vulkan here bought nothing.

     * `--enable-gpu` is passed, and without it there is no WebGPU adapter at all
     * — measured on this machine, `requestAdapter()` returns null, the app falls
     * back to WebGL2 on a CPU rasteriser, and every shot skips. That is the
     * honest outcome, but it is not a useful default for a suite whose whole
     * purpose is comparing GPU output.
     *
     * **A working Dawn device.** With `--enable-gpu` alone the adapter appears
     * and then `requestDevice()` fails with `DynamicLib.Open: dxil.dll Windows
     * Error 87` — Chromium's bundled DXC shader compiler will not load here.
     * Turning off the `use_dxc` Dawn feature falls back to FXC on the same D3D12
     * backend and the device comes up. Harmless where DXC does load.
     *
     * **The canonical shot resolution**, which is 1280x720 — see
     * `SHOT_VIEWPORT` in `tests/lib/shots.ts` for why it is not the 1600x900 the
