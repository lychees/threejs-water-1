  // ---- Island and shore dressing -----------------------------------------
  //
  // These are the *source* downloads, not what ships. Poly Haven publishes film
  // -quality geometry — `jacaranda_tree` is a 199 MB `.bin` for a background tree —
  // so `scripts/optimize-assets.mjs` decimates and Meshopt-encodes them into
  // `public/models/dressing/*.glb`, and only those are committed. 177 MB of
  // source becomes 15 MB shipped.
  //
  // Almost all of these come from Poly Haven's `smugglers_cove` collection,
  // which is the same set the hero ship is from. That matters for more than
  // convenience: assets authored for one scene share a scale, a texel density
  // and a colour response, so they sit together without per-asset correction.
  // Mixing packs is how dressing ends up looking like dressing.
  //
  // 1k throughout. These are background geometry seen from tens of metres away;
  // the ship is the only thing that earns 2k.
  // Coastline. `coast_line_01/02` are the pieces that make a shore read as a
  // shore rather than as a hill meeting water: they are authored as *edges*,
  // with a wave-cut platform and a back slope, so they sit along a contour
  // instead of being another rock standing on one.

/**
 * Sketchfab models, which exist here for one reason: **the reef.**
 *
 * Poly Haven publishes no coral, no sea fan, no sponge, no anemone and no fish —
 * all 521 of their models were checked, and `lambis_shell` is the entire marine
 * catalogue. ambientCG is materials and HDRIs. So every underwater living thing
 * in this project was either procedural or absent, and "absent" is what the
 * reef and the island shallows actually were: bare sand with a few kelp stipes
 * on it.
 *
 * Sketchfab fills that gap and costs something for it. Its download API is
 * authenticated — `GET /v3/models/<uid>/download` answers 401 without a token —
 * so this section is **opt-in and skipped when no token is present**. That is
 * not a degradation for anyone cloning the repository: the decimated outputs in
 * `public/models/dressing/` are committed exactly as the Poly Haven ones are,
 * and this step only needs to run when the optimiser does.
 *
 * To run it, put a token from <https://sketchfab.com/settings/password> into
 * `SKETCHFAB_API_TOKEN` or into a `sketchfab-token` file at the repository root
 * (git-ignored). It is a personal credential; it must not be committed.
 *
 * `licence` and `author` are not decoration. Half of these are CC-BY, which
 * legally requires the credit — see the Sketchfab table in ASSET_LICENSES.md,
 * which this manifest is the source of truth for.
